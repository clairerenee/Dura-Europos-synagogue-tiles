1933.255,1933.255,Aramaic Inscription,ca. 245 CE,"CHANGE This dedication tells us when the synagogue was erected/renovated, between 244 and 245 CE. The dedication mentions a number of elders by name as well as their role in the synagogue.  This dedication is written across two tiles (the second 1933.255). Most dedications found in religious settings are on the floor or walls, easy for people to see. The fact that this and other dedications in the synagogue are found on the ceiling may reflect how the congregation was more interested in having their good deeds recognized by the deity. ","""This building was erected in the year five hundred and fifty six, which is the second year of Philip Julius Caesar, during the presbyterate of Samuel, the priest, son of Yedaya the archon. Now those who stood in charge of this word (were) Abraham [Abram], the treasurer, and Samuel the son of Saphara, and...the proselyte. With the willing spirit they began to build in the fifty-sixth year, and they sent to...and they made haste...and they worked in...Blessing from the elders and from all the children of...they worked and toiled. ...Peace to them and their wives and all their children.""

This tile imagery is one of the more popular motifs found among the entire collection found in the synagogue. Scholars have identified the figure as a female goddess, ""Flora"" or ""Demeter-Persephone"", however, we have no evidence to support this. Personifications of cities, like Dura Europos, were typically depicted as women in the Greco-Roman world, so perhaps these figures are used as personifications. Of what, we do not know.
